# SQL-Projects

While practicing my SQL skills, I completed these projects that showcased SQL functions and formulas for exploratory data analysis. These projects involved complex queries and aggregation techniques to derive meaningful insights from raw data. I also learned how to optimize queries for better performance and gained experience with different SQL databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
