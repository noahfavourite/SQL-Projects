# SQL-Projects

While practicing my SQL skills, I completed these projects that showcased SQL functions and formulas for exploratory data analysis. These projects involved complex queries and aggregation techniques to derive meaningful insights from raw data. I also learned how to optimize queries for better performance and gained experience with different SQL databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. 

### PROJECTS

1. Olympic Games: The primary goal of this project was to utilize SQL queries to extract and analyze pertinent information from the comprehensive Olympic Games data set. 
This task involved understanding the data set, identifying relevant information, and then implementing SQL queries to fetch this information effectively. 
This process enabled me to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the Olympic Games, contributing to a deeper understanding of this global sporting event
